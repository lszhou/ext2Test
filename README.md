- Write 1GB of data to a single new file (data.txt).

- Read 4kB of data from (1KB_data.txt) 1 million times. Using syscall: open(2), read(2), lseek(2).

- Write 4kB of data to a single new file (data2.txt) 1 million times in a row. Using syscall: open(2), write(2), lseek(2).

- Read 1GB of data from the file generated by question(A)(namely,1GB_data.txt).

- Write 1GB of data to a single new file (data.txt).
